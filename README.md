# OVERVIEW

# INSTALLATION

# TECHNICAL APPROACH

#### A. Assigned a team leader
Alan Mond, Product Owner

#### B. Team Members (and corresponding ADPQ labor categories)
+ Product Manager: Diana D´Herrera
+ Technical Architect: Rafael Cárdenas
+ Interaction Designer/User Researcher: Diana D´Herrera
+ Visual Designer: Sofía Moya
+ Front End Developer: Isabel Anguiano 
+ Back End Developer: Miguel Morán
+ Dev Ops Engineer: Giovanni Cortés
+ Security Engineer: Rafael Cárdenas
+ Agile Coach: Paulina Bustos
+ Quality Assurance: Juan Pablo Escobar

#### C. Understood what people needed.

User research and testing included the following:
- Surveyed at least 12 California residents to understand current needs for an emergency alert system: [Initial Interview Questions.xlsx](https://github.com/shapeable/prototype-web/blob/technical_approach/supporting-documents/Initial%20iterview%20questions.xlsx)


#### D. Used at least three “human-centered design” techniques or tools

#### E. Used GitHub to document code commits

GitHub was used as the main documentation tool.  User Stories were created under the Issues, a Project was generated to keep track of progress and all commits and comments were stored in the same repository.  All design decision history has been documented in the repo.

#### F. Used Swagger to document the RESTful API, and provided a link to the Swagger API

#### G. Complied with Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act and WCAG 2.0

#### H.Created or used a design style guide

A design style guide was created by the designer. It contains the styles, fonts, iconography and typography etc. (Add link)

#### I. Performed usability tests with people

#### J. Used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype

#### K. Created a prototype that works on multiple devices and presents a responsive design

#### L. Used at least five modern and open-source technologies

This is a list of the open-source technologies and the use given for the creation of the prototype.
+ Docker - Production deployment
+ Swagger - Documentation of the API
+ Ruby on rails - Back end development
+ Rspec - Test
+ PostgreSQL - Database
+ Bourbon (for SCSS) - Style sheets


#### M. Deployed the prototype on IaaS

The prototype is deployed on the Heroku Server platform which allows for quick deployment to hosted servers.

#### N. Developed automated unit tests for their code

#### O. Setup or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and continuously deployed code to IaaS provider

#### P. Setup or used configuration management

#### Q. Setup or used continuous monitoring

#### R. Deployed their software in an open source container, such as Docker (i.e., utilized operating-system-level virtualization);

#### S. Provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine; and

#### T. Prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge

#### Examples of U.S. Digital Playbook usage
